/**
 * Is an entity static or dynamic? This example illustrates the borderline
 * between static and dynamic entities.
 *
 * An entity is static if it does not change in between one product cycle, 
 * that is, from one release to the next. If there are chances, that this will happen,
 * or if it is a hard business requirement, then the entity should be dynamic.
 * 
 *  Generally, it is preferable to use static entities (i.e. Soplet Lists), as they are far 
 *  more 'semantically coherent' (strong typed!) and easier to maintain than database
 *  based entities.
 *  
 *  In this specific case of the articles of a Pet Store, it has been
 *  proved that the items do not change frequently, maybe once in a year, 
 *  as also the marketing materials have to be adapted accordingly etc.
 *  
 *  Furthermore, it has been determined that (due to an agile development process
 *  in place) releasing the software in sync with a article/price update is not a big issue.
 *  For that reason it has been deemed justifiable to chose the static alternative 
 *  in this case.
